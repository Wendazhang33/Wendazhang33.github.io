Hello! I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://aos.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University,
where I work on the parameterization of ocean mesoscale eddies in climate models. I am a member of the [Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy Climate Process Team](https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io/). 
Prior to this position, I completed my Ph.D. at the School of Marine and 
Atmospheric Sciences, Stony Brook University.

My research focuses on understanding the generation and dissipation mechanisms of mesoscale eddies, how these eddies mix tracers, and how to represent their effects in numerical 
models that simulate the Earth's climate. 
I currently work on improving the representation of the vertical structure and energetics of mesoscale eddies in the ocean model of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. 
My approach involves theories and numerical modeling, including instability theories of geophysical flows, ocean circulation and turbulence theories, quasigeostrophic models, 
and both idealized and realistic general circulation models.

When I'm not doing research, I like running, hiking in mountains, and playing basketball and soccer.
