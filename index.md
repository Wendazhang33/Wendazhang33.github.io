Hello! I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://aos.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University,
where I work on the parameterization of ocean mesoscale eddies in climate models. I am a member of the [Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy Climate Process Team](https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io/). 
Prior to this position, I completed my Ph.D. at the School of Marine and 
Atmospheric Sciences, Stony Brook University.

My research focuses on unraveling the intricate mechanisms of mesoscale eddies---how they form, dissipate, and mix tracers.
A focal point of my work is to enhance the representation of eddy-induced mixing in numerical models simulating Earth's climate. 
I am currently involved in improving the parameterization of the vertical structure and energetics of mesoscale eddies in the ocean climate model of [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics 
Laboratory](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/). 
My approach involves theories and numerical modeling, including instability theories of geophysical flows, ocean circulation and turbulence theories, quasigeostrophic models, 
and both idealized and realistic general circulation models.

When I'm not doing research, I like running, hiking in mountains, and playing basketball and soccer.
